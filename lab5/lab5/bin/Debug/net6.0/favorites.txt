I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted.
We are wiser than we know.
The most I can do for my friend is simply be his friend.
Accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you together but do so with all your heart.
No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.
It is not so important to know everything as to appreciate what we learn.
Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.
